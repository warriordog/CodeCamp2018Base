Create a file in this directory named "data.json" in order to control your bot's behavior.
The file should contain everything between the dashes below (do not include the dashes!):

---------------------------------------------------
{
    "runOneBot": true,
    "botToRun": 1,
    "specificMaze": null,
    "playAllMazes": false,
    "logLevel": "DEBUG"
}
---------------------------------------------------

Here are the values and what they mean:

  - runOneBot
      Set this to either "true" or "false". You will want to set this to "true" to test only
      your code.

  - botToRun
      If runOneBot is "true", then this value should be your bot number (1-6)

  - specificMaze
      If you want to run through all the mazes, set this value to "null"
      If you want to run your bot through only one specific maze, enter the maze key here.
      For example: "3:3:TinyTim"

  - playAllMazes
      If you want to ignore the mazes you've already won, set this to "true". Otherwise, keep at "false".

  - logLevel
      If you're having trouble, we may want to "turn up" the logging level. Here are the possible values:
        NONE  - no logging, faster speed but harder to troubleshoot!
        ERROR - only errors are logged
        WARN  - only warnings and errors are logged
        INFO  - warning, errors and information is logged - THIS IS RECOMMENDED WHEN DONE TROUBLESHOOTING!
        DEBUG - debug messages are written - THIS IS RECOMMENDED FOR TROUBLESHOOTING
        TRACE - this is really only useful to the instructors, tons of data is produced!
